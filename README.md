# Case Study (Task 1) for the internship "Computer Science or Machine Learning Students in Advanced Analytics Network"

The files are Python codes allowing to plot network virtualization of the network architecture as part of the task 1 of the case study.

### Prerequisites

The code is written in Python 3.7 thanks to the libraries pandas, networkx, matplotlib.pyplot and plotly.graph_objects.
Thus Python and the librairies have to installed beforehand.

## Running the tests

The codes have to be downloaded and run in your local machine.

* The code named "Task1_Gwenda_Belmiloudi.py" contains hard coded data. Thus, the code just need to be runned without any modification.
The 2D virtualization will be plot as a Python plot and the 3D virtualization will be opened (automatically) in a browser (internet connection is not needed).
By passing the cursor on a node in the 3D virtualization, we can see the label of the node.

* The code named "Task1_Gwenda_Belmiloudi_Excel.py" needs to be modified to run. The data are retrieved from the excel file, so the user needs to replace de file path in the code (file_location).
The excel file can be another one but has to contain two sheets with the same amount of columns and all columns has to contain the same type of data (e.g. the color and the weight column).
However the number of lines can be different.
The rest works as the previous code.

## Additional files

Two pictures are included: "Network_vizualisation_2D.png" is a picture of the 2D vizualization and "Network_vizualisation_3D.png" is a screenshot of the 3D vizualization.
